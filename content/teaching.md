        I'm assembling a full record of teaching, TA, and mentorship roles. Copy the structure below for each experience you'd like highlighted and I'll populate the details.

        **Template**

        - `[Course Name]` — `[Role, e.g., Teaching Assistant]`
        - `University: [FAST-NUCES, etc.]`
        - `Dates: [e.g., Fall 2024]`
        - `Responsibilities: [Graded assignments, ran labs, held office hours for 100+ students, etc.]`

        **Example layout**

        - `Advanced Computer Vision` — `Teaching Assistant`
        - `University: FAST-NUCES`
        - `Dates: Fall 2024`
        - `Responsibilities: Graded projects, conducted lab sessions, hosted office hours, coordinated demo days.`
