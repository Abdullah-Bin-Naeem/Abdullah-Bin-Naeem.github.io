      title: '🎓 Teaching Experience'
      text: |-
        I am curating a teaching portfolio that highlights the mentorship and instructional roles I've taken on at FAST-NUCES and partner programs. If you're reviewing my profile ahead of a teaching or TA engagement, feel free to copy the template below and share the specifics you'd like me to highlight.

        **Template**

        - `[Course Name]`, `[Role — e.g., Teaching Assistant or Lab Demonstrator]`
        - `University: [Name]`
        - `Dates: [e.g., Fall 2024]`
        - `Responsibilities: [Graded assignments, led labs, held office hours, etc.]`

        I'm happy to provide detailed syllabi support, lab material reviews, or guest lectures upon request.
