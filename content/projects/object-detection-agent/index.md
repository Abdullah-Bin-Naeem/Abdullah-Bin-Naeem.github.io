Developed an autonomous game agent powered by YOLOv11 that reacts in real time to allies vs. enemies, classifies intent, and decides whether to assist or eliminate targets.

- Fine-tuned YOLOv11 with synthetic gameplay footage and label smoothing to stabilize predictions.
- Introduced latency-aware decision heuristics to keep FPS above 60 while running on consumer GPUs.
- Logged tactical choices and detection heatmaps to iterate on strategy with human teammates.
